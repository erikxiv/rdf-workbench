It allows for installing of Bower packages and moving of those packages to the appropriate location in a Mimosa application. This module is targeted for the 1.0 release of Bower.\n\nFor more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosajs.com\n\nFor more information regarding Bower, see http://bower.io\n\nNote: Version `0.14.0` or higher of Mimosa is required to use this module.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `mimosa mod:install mimosa-bower` to install this module into your global Mimosa install.\n\nTo install into a single project, add `'bower'` to your list of modules. Mimosa will install the module from NPM for you when you start up Mimosa.\n\n## Functionality\n\nWhen `mimosa bower`, `mimosa watch` or `mimosa build` are run, mimosa-bower will assess whether or not any packages need to be installed.  mimosa-bower installs packages to the `bower.bowerDir.path` directory, by default `.mimosa/bower_components`.\n\nIf `bower.copy.trackChanges` is set to `true` (the default), mimosa-bower keeps track of two artifacts to help it determine if installs need to occur.  First, it keeps track of the `bower.json` that was last used for an install. If the current `bower.json` is different, an install will be executed. Second,  mimosa-bower keeps track of the `bower` section of your project's mimosa-config for the last install. If it changes, an install will be executed.\n\nIf `bower.copy.trackChanges` is set to `false` and `bower.bowerDir.clean` is set to `false`, Bower `1.0`'s default processing will check to see if an install is necessary based on the contents of the `bower.bowerDir.path`. If it detects that nothing has changed, no install will be run.\n\nIf `bower.copy.trackChanges` is set to `false` and `bower.bowerDir.clean` is set to `true` (not recommended), then mimosa-bower has no way to determine if an install is necessary so mimosa-bower does not register itself to be run during `mimosa watch` and `mimosa build`. In this case it must be executed using the `mimosa bower` command.\n\nIf any packages are installed, mimosa-bower then moves them into the `vendor` directories as indicated by Mimosa's `vendor` config introduced with Mimosa `0.14.0`. The `bower.copy.strategy` determines how the files are copied over.  They can be copied to the root of the vendor directory (`vendorRoot`), to the root of the component directory (`packageRoot`, the default), or can be copied keeping the entire folder structure intact, `none`.\n\nmimosa-bower requires a valid `bower.json` at the root of project (in the same directory as mimosa-config).\n\nIf mimosa-bower encounters any version collisions, it will error out and indicate what those collisions are.\n\nIf mimosa-bower cannot identify the `main` file for a package because it hasn't been provided by the package author mimosa-bower will indicate that via a console log message. The `bower.copy.mainOverrides` can be used to indicate which files from the package are to use used.\n\n## New Commands\n\nThe following commands are added to Mimosa when mimosa-bower is included in a project.\n\n### bower & bower:install\n\n`bower` and `bower:install` are identical commands. These commands provide one off access to Bower installs without kicking off `watch` or `build`.  If `bower.bowerDir.clean` is set to `true`, this command is the only way to install Bower dependencies.\n\n### bower:clean [-c/--cache]\n\n`bower:clean` will remove all of the installed dependencies from their target directories in the `vendor` folder. It will also clean up any Bower package related folders that then become empty. Finally it will clean up the `bower.bowerDir.path` folder, removing all the temporary assets.\n\n`bower:clean -c` or `bower:clean --cache`, in addition to cleaning up installed dependencies, will also clean the Bower cache. This often is necessary when Bower updates, or if packages get updated without new versions.\n\n## Default Config\n\n```coffeescript\nbower:\n  bowerDir:\n    path: \".mimosa/bower_components\"\n    clean: true\n  copy:\n    enabled: true\n    trackChanges: true\n    outRoot: null\n    exclude:[]\n    mainOverrides: {}\n    strategy: \"packageRoot\"\n    forceLatest: true\n    pathMod: []\n```\n\n* `bowerDir.path`: string, the path to where mimosa-bower will initially install bower assets before moving the key assets into the `watch.sourceDir`\n* `bowerDir.clean`: boolean, whether or not to remove temporary bower assets after install.\n* `copy.enabled`: boolean, whether or not to copy assets out of the `bowerDir.path` and into `watch.sourceDir`\n* `copy.trackChanges`: When set to `true`, mimosa-bower will keep track of your `bower.json` and mimosa-config `bower` configuration and kick off installs if it detects changes. When set to `false`, bower's default checking is used. The Bower default checking is based on the contents of `bowerDir.path`. If `bowerDir.clean` is `true` and `trackChanges` is `false`, mimosa-bower will not perform installs during `watch` and `build` because installs would occur every time Mimosa starts up.\n* `copy.outRoot`: A string path to append to the `vendor` directories before copying in assets. All copied assets would go inside this directory. Example: `\"bower-managed\"`. `null` means no outRoot is applied. `null` is the default.\n* `copy.exclude`: An array of string paths or regexes. Files to exclude from\n copying. Paths should be relative to the `bowerDir.path` or absolute.\n* `copy.mainOverrides`: Occasionally bower packages do not clearly indicate what file is the main library file. In those cases, mimosa-bower cannot find the main files to copy them to the vendor directory. json2 is a good example. `mainOverrides` allows for setting which files should be copied for a package. The key for this object is the name of the package. The value is an array of path strings representing the package's main files. The paths should be relative to the root of the package. For example: `{\"json2\":[\"json2.js\",\"json_parse.js\"]}`. The paths can also be to directories. That will include all the directory's files.\n  `mainOverrides` packages can also be provided an object in addition to string paths. The object maps input paths to output paths and allow for specific placement of files and folders. Ex {\"json2\":{\"json2.js\":\"json-utils/json2.js\"}. In this case the \"json2.js\" file will be placed in \"json-utils/json2.js\" in the vendor.javascripts folder. If a file is provided as opposed to a directory, the output path must specify the output file name. Any directories copied in this way are copied entirely without manipulation of the folder structure.\n* `copy.strategy`: string, the copying strategy. `\"vendorRoot\"` places all files at the root of the vendor directory. `\"packageRoot\"` places the files in the vendor directory in a folder named for that package. `\"none\"` will copy the assets into the vendor directory without modification. `strategy` can also be an object with keys that match the names of packages and values of strategy types. When using a `strategy` object, the key of `\"*\"` provides a default `strategy`. If only 2 of 10 packages are specified in the object, the rest get the \"*\" strategy. If no `\"*\"` is provided, `\"packageRoot\"` is the assumed default.\n* `copy.forceLatest`: `forceLatest` is a means to quickly fix any problems with library versions. If you want to install the latest jquery, but one of your other libraries wants to install an older version the install will fail,  this flag will ensure the the latest version is selected. When the `forceLatest` results in a selection, a warning message is logged with the details of which version was picked and which versions were not.\n* `copy.pathMod`: `pathMod` can be an array of strings or a regexes. It is used to strip full pieces of a path from the output file when the selected `strategy` is `\"none\"` or a `pathOverride` object is used. If a bower package script is in `packageName/lib/js/foo.js` and pathMod is set to `[\"lib\", \"js\"]` the output path would have \"lib\" and \"js\" stripped. Feel free to suggest additions to this based on your experience!\n\n\n## Alternate Config\n\n```coffeescript\nbower:\n  copy:\n    mainOverrides:\n      foundation: [\n        \"js/foundation\"\n        {\"scss\":\"foundation\"}\n      ]\n    strategy:\n      \"*\": \"packageRoot\"\n      \"jquery\": \"vendorRoot\"\n      \"requirejs\": \"vendorRoot\"\n```\n\n* Only default overrides are shown.\n* This shows the alternate `strategy` configuration using specific strategy-to-package mappings.\n* It also shows the alternate `mainOverrides` configuration, with the `foundation` package's `js/foundation` folder being pulled in according to the `\"*\"` strategy (`packageRoot`), and the `foundation/scss` folder being pulled into a `foundation` folder and otherwise left entirely in tact without any path manipulations.",
