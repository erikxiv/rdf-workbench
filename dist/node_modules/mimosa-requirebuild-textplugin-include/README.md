mimosa-requirebuild-textplugin-include
===========

Say that 3 times fast.

## Overview

This is a Mimosa module.  It both serves as a module to be used with Mimosa, and also serves as an example for how one would write a module to intercept the r.js configurations before optimization occurs.

The actual function of this module is to find text dependencies and include them in the `include` array for a r.js run via the requirejs text plugin.

## Usage

Add `'mimosa-requirebuild-textplugin-include'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start up.

## Functionality

The `'mimosa-requirebuild-textplugin-include'` module configuration is a pointer to a directory of files to include, the requirejs text plugin and a list of extensions to include in the r.js `include` array appended to the text plugin.

## Default Config

```
requireBuildTextPluginInclude:
  folder: ""
  pluginPath: "vendor/text"
  extensions: ["html"]
```

* `folder`: a string, a directory within the `watch.javascriptDir` that narrows down the search for files to include.  If left alone, `watch.javascriptDir` is used.
* `pluginPath`: a string, the AMD path to your requirejs text plugin
* `extensions`: an array of strings,  list of extensions for files to include in the r.js config's 'include' array attached to the text plugin at `pluginPath` path listed above.  Ex: vendor/text!app/foo.html. All files in the watch.javascriptDir/folder that match this extension will be pushed into the array and already present array entries will be left alone. Extensions should not include the period.
